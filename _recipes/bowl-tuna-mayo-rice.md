ingredients: |
  - 1 (5-ounce) can tuna (preferably any variety stored in oil), well drained
  - 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
  - 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
  - Â½ teaspoon soy sauce
  - 1 cup cooked white rice (preferably short- or medium-grain)
  - Toasted white or black sesame seeds, furikake or chopped scallions, for topping (optional)

  1. In a small bowl, stir the tuna, mayonnaise, sesame oil and soy sauce to combine.
  2. Add the white rice to a bowl and spoon the tuna mixture on top.
  3. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds, furikake or scallions, if using.

notes: |
  - You can adjust the seasonings to your taste: Use as much or as little soy sauce as you'd like for a savory accent.
  - You can lean into the nuttiness of this rice bowl by sowing the top with toasted sesame seeds, or amp up the savoriness with furikake or scallions.
