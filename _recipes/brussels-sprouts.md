ingredients: |
  - 2 pounds brussels sprouts, bottoms trimmed only very slightly
  - 4 tablespoons olive oil
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 lemon

instructions: |
  1. Heat oven to 350°F. Working over a bowl, use a paring knife to shave off several thin layers from the bottom of each sprout, pulling off the darker outer leaves into the bowl, until you have just the tight, light-green core. Set aside the bowl of leaves, then slice any very large cores in half.
  2. Combine the cores and 2 tablespoons oil on a rimmed baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange any cut pieces cut-side down and roast, shaking the sheet once or twice, until cores are just tender, 30-35 minutes.
  3. Remove baking sheet and increase oven temperature to 425°F. Toss the reserved leaves with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and season lightly with salt and pepper. Scatter the leaves over the cores on the baking sheet and return to the oven. Roast until the leaves are bright green and crispy in places and the cores are caramelized, 10-15 minutes.
  4. Just before serving, grate about half the lemon zest over the sprouts and squeeze juice from half the lemon over the baking sheet. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

notes: |
  - This dish can be prepared ahead of time by separating the leaves from the cores a day in advance. Store them separately in lidded containers in the refrigerator.
