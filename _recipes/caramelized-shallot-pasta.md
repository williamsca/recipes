ingredients: |
  - Â¼ cup olive oil
  - 6 large shallots, very thinly sliced
  - 5 garlic cloves, 4 thinly sliced, 1 finely chopped
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, plus more to taste
  - 1 (2-ounce) can anchovy fillets (about 12), drained
  - 1 (4.5-ounce) tube or (6-ounce) can of tomato paste (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup)
  - 10 ounces pasta
  - 1 cup parsley, leaves and tender stems, finely chopped
  - Flaky sea salt

instructions: |
  1. Heat olive oil in a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add shallots and thinly sliced garlic, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallots have completely softened and caramelized with golden-brown edges, approximately 15 to 20 minutes.
  2. Add red pepper flakes and anchovies to the caramelized shallots. Stir continuously to incorporate the anchovies into the shallot mixture, allowing them to dissolve completely, about 2 minutes.
  3. Add tomato paste and season with additional salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly to prevent scorching, until the tomato paste has caramelized slightly, darkening from bright red to a deeper brick red color, approximately 2 minutes.
  4. Remove from heat and transfer approximately half of the mixture to a resealable container, leaving the remainder in the cooking vessel. (The reserved portion can be refrigerated for later use in another batch of pasta, as a topping for roasted vegetables, spooned over fried eggs, or served beneath crispy chicken thighs.)
  5. For serving, cook pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until very al dente (slightly firmer than usual). Transfer the pasta to the Dutch oven containing the remaining shallot mixture (or to a skillet if using the leftover portion) along with 1 cup of pasta cooking water.
  6. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring vigorously to coat each piece of pasta, using a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up any caramelized bits from the bottom of the pot. Continue cooking until the pasta is fully coated and the sauce has thickened but remains slightly fluid, approximately 3 to 5 minutes.
  7. In a small bowl, combine the parsley and finely chopped garlic clove. Season with flaky salt and pepper. Divide the pasta among serving bowls, or transfer to one large serving bowl, and garnish with the parsley mixture and additional red pepper flakes if desired.

notes: |
  - This recipe makes enough caramelized shallot mixture for two batches of pasta.
  - The reserved portion can be refrigerated and used in various applications: tossed with another batch of pasta, spread on roasted vegetables, spooned over fried eggs, or served with crispy chicken thighs.
  - The caramelized shallots are the star of this dish, providing sweetness that balances with the salty anchovies and tangy tomato paste.
