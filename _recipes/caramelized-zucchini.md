title: Caramelized Zucchini Pasta
description: This recipe transforms two pounds of grated zucchini into a rich, sweet and jammy sauce for pasta. Like caramelized onions but made with zucchini!
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 35 minutes
servings: 4
category: Dinner
protein: vegetarian

ingredients: |
  - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - 2 pounds zucchini, coarsely grated (about 3 large zucchini)
  - 8 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed
  - ½ cup basil leaves, stems reserved
  - Kosher salt and black pepper
  - 1 pound ridged or curly pasta (like medium shells or casarecce)
  - ½ cup finely grated Parmesan or pecorino, plus more for serving
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice

instructions: |
  1. In a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter and oil. Add zucchini, garlic, basil stems and half the basil leaves. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until pooling with liquid, 5-7 minutes. Uncover and cook until liquid evaporates and zucchini starts to sizzle, 7-10 minutes.
  2. Continue cooking until zucchini is very soft, dark green, and reduced to about 1 cup, 20-25 minutes more. When browned bits build up, add a couple tablespoons of water and scrape them up. If you see burning, deglaze with water and lower heat.
  3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. When zucchini is nearly done, cook pasta until al dente. Reserve 2 cups pasta water, then drain.
  4. Remove herb stems from zucchini and reduce heat to medium. Add the pasta, 1 cup pasta water, and Parmesan. Stir until pasta is glossed with sauce, adding more pasta water if needed. Stir in lemon juice and remaining basil, then season to taste.

notes: |
  - Caramelized zucchini can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to a week or frozen.
  - Consider adding anchovy, preserved lemon or red-pepper flakes to the zucchini for additional flavor.
  - This concentrated zucchini mixture works well on sandwiches, pizzas, or antipasti spreads too.
