temperature: 400°F
source: 

ingredients: |
  - 1 spaghetti squash
  - Olive oil
  - Salt and pepper
  - 1 c panko breadcrumbs
  - 1/2 c parmesan cheese, plus more for topping
  - 1 tsp oregano
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1/4 tsp pepper
  - 1 lb thin chicken breasts
  - 1 egg
  - 1 onion, diced
  - 2-3 cloves garlic, minced
  - Marinara sauce
  - Mozzarella cheese, for topping

instructions: |
  1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut spaghetti squash in half lengthwise, scoop out seeds. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Place cut side down on a baking sheet and roast for 35-40 minutes, until tender.
  2. While squash is roasting, prepare the chicken. In a shallow dish, combine panko, parmesan, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Beat an egg in a separate dish.
  3. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Dip chicken in the beaten egg, then coat with the panko mixture, pressing to adhere.
  4. Bake the breaded chicken at 400°F for 15-20 minutes alongside the spaghetti squash, until cooked through.
  5. In a skillet over medium heat, sauté onion until translucent. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute. Use a fork to scrape the spaghetti squash strands into the skillet. Add some marinara sauce and stir to combine.
  6. Transfer the spaghetti squash mixture to a baking dish. Slice the chicken and arrange on top of the squash. Pour additional marinara sauce over the chicken, then sprinkle with mozzarella and additional parmesan cheese.
  7. Broil until cheese is melted and browned, about 3-5 minutes.

notes: |
  - You can use jarred marinara sauce or homemade for this recipe.
  - For a spicier version, add red pepper flakes to the marinara sauce.
  - The spaghetti squash can be roasted ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to use.
