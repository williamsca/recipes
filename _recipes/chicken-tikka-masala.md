protein: chicken
source: 40 Aprons

ingredients: |
  **Marinade:**
  - 2 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts, diced (about 1.5 pounds)
  - 1 cup plain full-fat yogurt
  - 1 teaspoon turmeric
  - 2 teaspoons garam masala
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice (about half a lemon)
  - 2 teaspoons black pepper
  - 1/4 teaspoon dried ginger

  **For the sauce:**
  - 4 tablespoons ghee or butter (1/4 cup)
  - 1 medium white onion, diced
  - 1-2 serrano chiles, minced (see notes for heat level)
  - 5 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh ginger, grated
  - 3 1/2 teaspoons garam masala
  - 1 teaspoon paprika
  - 1 15-ounce can tomato sauce
  - 1 green bell pepper, deseeded and sliced into strips
  - 1 tablespoon dried fenugreek leaves
  - Salt to taste
  - 2 cups heavy cream or half-and-half

  **For serving:**
  - Basmati rice
  - Naan
  - Fresh cilantro, chopped

instructions: |
  1. **Marinate the Chicken:** Combine all marinade ingredients except chicken in a medium bowl and stir well. Add chicken and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour, up to overnight.
  2. **Make the Sauce:** Heat the ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add serrano chiles, garlic, ginger, and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until a nice toffee color, about 20 minutes, adding a few drops of water here and there if drying out and sticking. Add garam masala and paprika and stir well. Cook until fragrant, a few minutes, adding a couple of tablespoons of water if necessary to reduce sticking.
  3. **Blend the Base:** Stir in the tomato sauce then transfer to a blender and blend until smooth. Return the sauce to your skillet. Add sliced bell pepper, fenugreek, and salt.
  4. **Cook the Chicken:** Meanwhile, preheat broiler and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. Place chicken pieces on top of the rack. Broil, turning occasionally until browned in spots and cooked through, about 8 minutes total.
  5. **Finish the Dish:** Simmer sauce for 30 minutes on medium-low heat or until thick and more like a paste than a sauce. Add the heavy cream and stir until very smooth. Taste and correct seasonings. Add chicken, stir well, and serve over basmati rice with naan. Top with plenty of chopped cilantro.

notes: |
  **Heat Levels:**
  - Mild: 1 serrano chile, seeded
  - Medium: 1 serrano chile, not seeded
  - Hot: 2 serrano chiles, not seeded

  - Use coconut cream instead of heavy cream for a dairy-free alternative.
  - For best results, don't rush the caramelization of the onions, garlic, and ginger - this is key to developing the deep flavor.
  - Chicken thighs can be substituted for chicken breasts for more flavor.
  - The dish can be made ahead and reheated; in fact, the flavors often improve after a day in the refrigerator.
