ingredients: |
  **Dough**
  - 3/4 cup warm milk
  - 2 1/4 teaspoons quick rise yeast
  - 1/4 cup granulated sugar
  - 1 egg plus 1 egg yolk at room temperature
  - 1/4 cup butter, melted
  - 3 cups (360g) bread flour, plus more for dusting

  **Filling**
  - 2/3 cup dark brown sugar
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon
  - 1/4 cup butter, softened

  **Cream Cheese Frosting**
  - 4 oz (112g) cream cheese, softened
  - 3 tablespoons butter, softened
  - 3/4 cup powdered sugar
  - 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

instructions: |
  1. Warm milk to 110°F by microwaving for 40 seconds. Transfer to the bowl of an electric mixer and sprinkle yeast on top. Add in sugar, egg, yolk, and melted butter. Mix until well combined. Stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough forms.
  2. Place dough hook on stand mixer and knead dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. Dough should form a ball and be slightly sticky. Add flour if needed dough is too sticky.
  3. Transfer dough to a well-oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow to rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size.
  4. Transfer dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14x9 inch rectangle. Spread softened butter over dough leaving a 1/4 margin at the far side.
  5. In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough, then rub the brown sugar mixture into the butter.
  6. Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9-inch side and place seam side down, making sure to seal the edges of the dough. Cut into 1-inch sections with a serrated knife.
  7. Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x9 inch baking pan or round 9-inch cake pan. Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30 minutes.
  8. Preheat oven to 350°F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. Remove from oven and let cool for 5-10 minutes before frosting.
  9. To make the frosting, mix together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until smooth. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve.

notes: | 
  - To make overnight cinnamon rolls, cut as directed, arrange in a pan lined with parchment paper, cover well with plastic wrap, and place in the fridge overnight. In the morning, bring the cinnamon rolls to room temperature and let them rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking as directed.
