ingredients: |
  - 1 (3 pound) chuck roast, fat trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces
  - 2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for serving
  - 1 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper, plus more for serving
  - ¼ cup AP flour, Gluten Free flour or cornstarch
  - ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 large onion, diced
  - 4 celery ribs, diced
  - 7 large carrots, 4 diced and 3 cut into 1½-inch pieces
  - 5 garlic cloves, minced
  - 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 2 sprigs fresh thyme
  - 8 cups beef stock
  - 2 teaspoons beef bouillon
  - 4 small yukon gold potatoes, quartered or 2 russet potatoes, peeled and cut in 1-inch pieces
  - ½ pound green beans, trimmed, cut into 2-inch pieces
  - ¼ cup finely chopped flat leaf parsley, for serving
  - Crusty bread, for serving

instructions: |
  1. Season the chuck roast all over with the salt and pepper. Add the flour or cornstarch to a large bowl, add the beef and toss to coat well.
  2. Heat 3 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat. Once the oil just begins to smoke, working in batches, add the beef and cook until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a plate.
  3. Reduce the heat to medium, add the onions, celery, and diced carrots to the Dutch oven. If necessary, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cook, stirring often, until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and continue cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute more. Stir in the tomato paste, bay leaves and thyme.
  4. Return the beef to the Dutch oven along with the beef stock. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 1½ hours, or until beef is falling apart.
  5. Uncover and stir in the beef bouillon, carrot pieces, potatoes, and green beans. Cook until potatoes and carrots are fork tender, about 30 minutes more. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
  6. Ladle stew into bowls. Top with parsley and serve with crusty bread.
