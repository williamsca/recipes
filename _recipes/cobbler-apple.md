ingredients: |
  **For the apples:**
  - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 8 cups peeled and sliced apples (1/4-inch slices; about 7 apples)
  - 3 tablespoons packed light or dark brown sugar
  - 1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lemon juice
  - 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
  - 1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
  - ¼ teaspoon ground allspice
  - ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg

  **For the topping:**
  - 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
  - 1 cup granulated sugar
  - 1 cup buttermilk
  - 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
  - 1¾ cups all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
  - 2 teaspoons baking powder
  - ½ teaspoon salt
  - 1 tablespoon granulated sugar + ½ teaspoon cinnamon, for sprinkling (optional)

instructions: |
  1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9×13-inch baking pan.
  2. **Pre-cook the apples:** Melt 2 tablespoons of butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the apple slices, brown sugar, lemon juice, flour, and spices. Cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the apples are coated and begin to soften. Transfer apple filling to the prepared baking pan.
  3. **Make the topping:** Whisk the melted butter and sugar together in a medium bowl. Add the buttermilk, vanilla, flour, baking powder, and salt, and whisk until combined and mostly smooth. Some small lumps are OK. Pour and spread the batter over the apples. Sprinkle cinnamon-sugar evenly over the top. Use a butter knife to gently swirl the topping as best you can.
  4. Bake on the center rack for 48-55 minutes or until the topping is golden and the apple filling is bubbling around the edges. If the top browns too quickly, loosely cover with aluminum foil about halfway through baking.
  5. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 5 minutes before serving. Serve warm, room temperature, or cold; on its own or topped with vanilla ice cream.

notes: |
  - You can use either low-fat or whole buttermilk. If you can't find either, use whole milk. No need to make a buttermilk substitute with lemon juice or vinegar.
