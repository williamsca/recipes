servings: 6
category: Soup
temperature: 
source: The Modern Proper
protein: chicken

ingredients: |
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 1 small yellow onion, diced, about 1 cup
  - 1 medium carrot, diced, 3/4 cup
  - 2 celery ribs, diced, ¾ cup
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - ¼ cup unsalted butter (4 Tbsp)
  - ¼ cup all-purpose flour
  - 4 cups chicken stock or broth
  - 1 cup milk, whole milk preferably
  - ½ teaspoon sea salt, plus more to taste
  - ¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
  - 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill
  - 3 cups shredded cooked chicken, from a rotisserie or 2 large chicken breasts, poached in water
  - ⅓ cup grated fresh Parmesan cheese
  - 4 green onions, chopped, for garnish

instructions: |
  1. Add the olive oil to a large stockpot set over medium heat. Once the oil is glistening, add the onions, carrots and celery and cook until the carrots and celery are beginning to soften, about 8-10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute longer.
  2. Add the butter to the pan. Once the butter is bubbling, sprinkle in the flour and stir until a thick paste is formed, cooking for about 1 minute. Slowly add the chicken stock, stirring and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as the soup is boiling, reduce the heat and simmer until the carrots and celery are tender, and the soup has thickened about 5 more minutes.
  3. Add the milk, salt, pepper, dill, chicken and Parmesan cheese, stir to combine. Let simmer for a few minutes longer until the chicken is warmed through and the parmesan is fully incorporated.
  4. Serve the soup topped with green onions, extra Parmesan if desired.

notes: |
  This soup will keep well in the fridge for a few days and you can definitely freeze it if you'd like to! It'll keep in the freezer for up to three months. Simply thaw it out in the fridge and gently warm it in a pot on the stove stirring often so that the broth doesn't separate.
