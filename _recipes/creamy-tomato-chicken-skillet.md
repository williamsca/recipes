description: 
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 25 minutes
servings: 4
category: Dinner
protein: chicken

ingredients: |
  - 4 boneless skinless chicken breasts, (about 1½ pounds)
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
  - 1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - 2 tablespoons tomato paste
  - 3 cloves garlic, minced
  - 1 teaspoon fennel seeds
  - ¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, (optional)
  - 1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes
  - 1 cup heavy cream
  - ½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
  - ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving
  - 4 cups packed kale, tough stems discarded and leaves roughly chopped
  - ¼ cup basil leaves, thinly sliced

instructions: |
  1. Season the chicken all over with ½ teaspoon of the salt. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Once the oil is glistening, add the chicken and cook until browned, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
  2. To the same skillet, add the tomato paste, garlic, fennel seeds, and red pepper flakes and cook stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the crushed tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cook for 3 minutes, then stir in the heavy cream, pepper, ¼ cup of the parmesan and kale until the kale is just wilted, about 3 minutes more. Season with the remaining ½ teaspoon of salt and return the chicken to the skillet. Cook until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F on an instant read thermometer, about 5 minutes more.
  3. Top with the basil and the remaining parmesan and serve.
