title: Crispy Cutlets with Fennel Salad
category: Dinner
servings: 2
prep_time: 20 minutes
cook_time: 10 minutes
protein: chicken
source: Alison Roman
ingredients: |
  - 2 cups panko bread crumbs
  - Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 large egg, beaten to blend
  - 1 8-10 oz. boneless, skinless chicken breast or pork chop
  - 1 shallot, thinly sliced
  - 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus 1 quartered lemon for serving
  - 1 fennel bulb or 4 stalks celery, thinly sliced
  - 1 cup mixed herbs, such as parsley, chives and dill, coarsely chopped (or just use fennel fronds)
  - ¼ cup canola oil, plus more as needed
  - Dijon mustard and cornichon pickles, for serving (optional)

instructions: |
  1. Place panko in a shallow baking dish or wide, shallow bowl and season with salt; set aside.
  2. Whisk egg with a teaspoon of water until well blended, season with salt, and place in another shallow baking dish or wide, shallow bowl; set aside.
  3. Slice chicken breast (or pork chop) in half horizontally to create two thin cutlets. Working with one piece at a time, place the cutlet between two sheets of parchment paper (alternatively, use a resealable plastic bag or plastic wrap).
  4. Using a small, heavy-bottomed skillet, carefully pound the chicken or pork until approximately ⅛" thick. Avoid pounding too thin, as this may make the meat difficult to bread and less enjoyable to eat.
  5. Season the chicken or pork with salt on both sides, then dip into the egg mixture. Using your hands (or tongs), lift the cutlet, allowing excess egg to drip off. Place directly into the bread crumbs and thoroughly coat both sides, pressing firmly to ensure the crumbs adhere to the entire surface. Shake off any excess crumbs and set aside on a plate or baking sheet. Repeat with remaining cutlets. (Note: These can be refrigerated at this stage for up to two days, or frozen for up to 2 weeks.)
  6. Combine shallot and 2 tablespoons lemon juice in a medium bowl and season with salt; set aside.
  7. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add cutlets and press gently with tongs to ensure contact with the skillet and oil, which promotes even browning as the meat contracts. Cook until golden brown and crispy on one side, approximately 3 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until the second side is equally golden brown, about 2-3 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt. Repeat with remaining cutlets if necessary.
  8. To serve, add fennel and any fronds or herbs to the shallot mixture, toss, and season with salt and pepper. Place a crispy cutlet on each plate with the fennel salad alongside (not on top, to preserve the crunchy exterior). Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over each bite, mustard for dipping, and cornichons for accompaniment.

notes: |
  - The pounding technique is what makes these cutlets exceptionally crispy.
  - The salad should be served alongside rather than on top of the cutlets to maintain crispness.
  - This recipe can easily be doubled for more servings.
  - Between batches, wipe the skillet clean of any burnt crumbs.
