ingredients: |
  **Cupcakes**
  - 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp baking soda
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
  - pinch of ground nutmeg
  - pinch of ground cloves
  - 3/4 cup canned pumpkin
  - 1/2 cup granulated sugar
  - 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
  - 1/2 cup vegetable oil
  - 2 eggs

  **Frosting**
  - 1 cup unsalted butter, room temp.
  - 8 oz. cream cheese, room temp.
  - 2 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
  - 4 cups powdered sugar

instructions: |
  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
  2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.
  3. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, both sugars, and the vegetable oil until completely combined, making sure to break up any chunks of brown sugar. Whisk in eggs one at a time. Add the flour mixture in two additions, folding with a spatula until no flour pockets remain.
  4. Divide the batter between the baking cups, filling each about two-thirds full. Bake until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 18 to 22 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting.
  5. With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the butter until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream cheese, vanilla, and salt and continue to beat for an additional 2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the powdered sugar gradually. Mix until smooth and combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.
  6. Using a decorating bag and tip (e.g., Ateco #827) or an offset spatula, frost the tops of the cupcakes.
