ingredients: |
  **Cupcakes**
  - 1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp baking soda
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
  - pinch of ground nutmeg
  - pinch of ground cloves
  - 3/4 cup canned pumpkin
  - 1/2 cup granulated sugar
  - 1/2 cup dark brown sugar
  - 1/2 cup vegetable oil
  - 2 eggs

  **Frosting**
  - 1 cup unsalted butter, room temp.
  - 8 oz. cream cheese, room temp.
  - 2 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
  - 2-4 cups powdered sugar

instructions: |
  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
  2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.
  3. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin, both sugars, and the vegetable oil until completely combined, making sure to break up any chunks of brown sugar. Whisk in eggs one at a time. Add the flour mixture in two additions, folding with a spatula until no flour pockets remain.
  4. Divide the batter between the baking cups, filling each about two-thirds full. Bake until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 18 to 22 minutes. Allow to cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before frosting.
  5. With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat the butter until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the cream cheese, vanilla, and salt and continue to beat for an additional 2 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed. Reduce the mixer speed to low and add the powdered sugar gradually. Start with 2 cups and add if you want it more sweet. Mix until smooth and combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Increase the mixer speed to medium-high and beat until light and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes.
  6. Using a decorating bag and tip, frost the tops of the cupcakes.
