description: Kaitlyn rated these danishes as "the best thing we've made so far." They were so good that we ate two each, felt sick, and immediately decided not to share any with my suitemates.

effort: high
duration: hours

ingredients: |
  - 8 oz cream cheese
  - 1 1/4 cups confectioners' sugar
  - 1 large egg yolk
  - 1 pinch salt
  - 1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract
  - 1 batch [danish dough](/recipes/recipes/dough-danish/)
  - 1 large egg, lightly beaten
  - 2 tbsp whole milk

instructions: |
  1. In a large bowl, beat together the cream cheese, 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar, the egg yolk, the salt and the vanilla until smooth. Transfer the mixture to a resealable plastic bag; set aside.
  2. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out into a 12 1/2-inch square. Trim 1/4 inch off each edge. Cut the dough into nine 4-inch squares. Brush the corners of each square with a bit of the beaten egg, then fold each corner into the center and press down gently. Transfer the squares to 2 parchment-lined baking sheets.
  3. Cut the tip off one corner of the filled plastic bag so you have a 1/2-inch hole. Use the bag to pipe the cheese filling onto the center of each dough square. Loosely cover the pastries with plastic wrap and let stand until slightly puffed, about 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes.
  4. Heat oven to 425°F.
  5. Remove the plastic and gently brush the top and sides of the dough with the beaten egg. Bake for 10 minutes, then rotate the sheets and reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Continue to bake until pastries are puffed and deep golden brown, another 6 to 8 minutes.
  6. Meanwhile, whisk together the remaining 1 cup confectioners' sugar and the milk.
  7. Let the Danish cool slightly on the sheet then drizzle with the glaze. Serve warm or at room temperature.

notes: |
  - The dough can be prepared through Step 5 and frozen for up to 1 month. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using.
  - Fresh berries or jam can be added just before baking for variety.
