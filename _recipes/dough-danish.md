prep_time: 1 hour plus chilling time
servings: 9

category: Fika

ingredients: |
  - 1 1/2 cups bread flour, plus more for surface
  - 2 tbsp granulated sugar
  - 2 tsp active dry yeast
  - 3/4 tsp kosher salt
  - 14 tbsp cold, unsalted butter, roughly cubed
  - 1 large egg
  - 1/4 cup cold whole milk

instructions: |
  1. Combine the flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Add the butter and pulse to combine. The butter should be the size of small marbles and peas. Transfer this mixture to a medium bowl.
  2. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, milk and 2 tablespoons water.
  3. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture. Using a rubber spatula, fold the mixture until it is evenly moistened. Turn the dough out onto a piece of plastic wrap, shape into a small rectangle, and wrap well. Chill for at least 3 hours, and up to 2 days.
  4. On a lightly floured surface, using a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to an 8-by-15-inch rectangle. With a short side facing you, fold the dough in thirds like a letter, bringing the top third of the dough down, then folding the bottom third up. Use a bench scraper to help lift and fold the dough if necessary. At this point, the dough will be rough and shaggy with visible butter pieces; as you roll and fold the dough it will come together. Rotate the dough 90 degrees. Repeat the rolling and folding process, then rotate the dough once more and roll and fold again. As you work, dust the work surface, your hands and the rolling pin with flour as necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  5. Repeat the entire rolling and folding process one more time for a grand total of six turns. If the dough starts to fight you and become difficult to roll at any point, just pop it in the fridge for an extra rest. Wrap the dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight.

notes: |
  - If you don't have a food processor, cut the butter into 1/4-inch pieces and chill until firm. Fold the cold butter pieces into the flour mixture and continue with the recipe as written.
  - A roll of cookie dough can double as a rolling pin in a pinch.
  - The dough should rest in the refrigerator for a minimum of 6 hours total through the various chilling stages.
