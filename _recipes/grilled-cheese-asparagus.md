title: Grilled Cheese with Asparagus
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 25 minutes
servings: 4
category: Dinner
protein: vegetarian
temperature: 400°F
source: The Modern Proper

ingredients: |
  - 8 slices of ciabatta, or any other rustic bread without large holes
  - 4 tbsp good mayonnaise
  - 4 tbsp room temperature butter
  - 4 tbsp sweet red pepper pesto
  - 3/4 lb thin asparagus spears
  - 6 oz gruyere, room temperature and grated
  - 6 oz mozzarella, room temperature and thinly sliced
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - salt and pepper

instructions: |
  1. Preheat oven 400°. In a large bowl toss asparagus with olive oil, salt and pepper until coated. In a single layer, spread asparagus on a baking sheet and bake on center rack for 10-15 minutes.
  2. In a small bowl, mix mayonnaise and butter until fully combined. Assembly sandwiches by spreading the butter-mayo mixture on one side of each piece of bread. On the inside of the sandwich start your layering with the sweet red pepper pesto, followed by grated gruyere, asparagus, mozzarella and second piece of bread.
  3. Over low heat, warm up a heavy cast iron skillet. In small batches begin to grill your sandwiches. Carefully watch to make sure that you aren't burning the butter-mayo, flip as soon as one side is golden brown and continue with other side. This process should take 8-10 min on each side. Do not rush this process or you will compromise the crispy golden crust of a perfect grilled cheese.
  4. Once both sides are golden brown, transfer to a plate and serve with soup or salad and enjoy. Beware, you may want more than one...or two.

notes: |
  - The butter-mayo mixture is the secret to achieving a perfectly crispy, golden crust.
  - Make sure your cheeses are at room temperature for the best melting.
  - Rustic bread without large holes works best to keep the cheese from leaking out.
