prep_time: 2.5 hours
temperature: 375째F
servings: 25-30
category: Fika

ingredients: |
  **Dough**
  - 30g yeast
  - 250g milk
  - 570g flour
  - 3g salt
  - 5g ground cardamom
  - 90g powdered sugar
  - 55g egg
  - 110g butter, room temperature
  - 1 egg, for brushing
  - pearl sugar, for sprinkling

  **Cinnamon and Almond Filling**
  - 200g almond paste
  - 10g vanilla sugar
  - 30g cinnamon
  - 150g butter, room temperature

  **Sugar Syrup**
  - 150g water
  - 95g powdered sugar

instructions: |
  1. Toss the yeast in the bowl of your food processor. Heat the milk to lukewarm, beat the yeast and mix around.
  2. Add the remaining ingredients in addition to the butter. Run the dough slowly with a hook. When the dough has gone together, you increase the pace a little and add the butter a little at a time. Run the dough for 10 minutes in machine until it forms gluten and feels elastic, glossy and fine on the surface.
  3. Lay out the dough on a floured board and allow to rest for 20 minutes.
  4. Mix almond, vanilla sugar and cinnamon. Add the butter a little until you have a smooth filling.
  5. Pour out the dough 3-4 mm thick, higher than wide if it should be folded in the middle. Spread out the cinnamon filling on the rolled dough and fold the dough in two, cut into strips and twist to make buns. Place on a baking sheet with parchment paper. If you don't want to make a knot, spread out the dough 3-4 mm thick, wider than high and roll into a roll. Slice into big buns, put into forms. Let rise to double size, about 1.5 - 2 hours.
  6. Mix the water and sugar together in a saucepan and boil until all sugar crystals have melted. Set aside.
  7. Preheat the oven to 375째F (hot air). Brush the buns with egg and sprinkle with pearl sugar. Bake for 9-11 minutes, until they get a nice golden brown color.
  8. Just when the buns have come out of the oven, brush them with the sugar syrup. The buns will get a nice shine and stay moist.

notes: |
  - The Indian spice store probably has cardamom.
  - Traditional Swedish pearl sugar (p채rlsocker) works best for topping, but regular pearl sugar can be substituted.
  - The timing of the sugar syrup glaze is important - brush it on immediately when the buns come out of the oven.
