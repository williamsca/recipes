description: 
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 30 minutes
servings: 4
category: Dinner
protein: chicken

ingredients: |
  - 4 boneless, skinless, chicken breasts, about 2 pounds
  - 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 cup heavy cream
  - ½ cup chicken stock
  - 1 teaspoon chicken flavor "Better Than Bouillon", or 1 chicken bouillon cube
  - ½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
  - 1 (7-ounce) jar sun-dried tomatoes, drained and roughly chopped
  - 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
  - ½ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
  - ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
  - ¼ cup thinly sliced fresh basil leaves
  - Cooked pasta or mashed potatoes, for serving (optional)

instructions: |
  1. Pat the chicken dry. Season all over with 1 teaspoon of the salt.
  2. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the oil is glistening, add the chicken and cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
  3. To the same skillet, add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in heavy cream, chicken stock, bouillon, ¼ cup of the parmesan cheese, sun dried tomatoes, Italian seasoning, pepper, ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, and remaining ½ teaspoon salt until combined.
  4. Return the chicken to the skillet. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium low. Cook until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 5-8 more minutes.
  5. Top the chicken with basil, remaining ¼ cup Parmesan cheese, and remaining red pepper flakes. Serve over pasta or mashed potatoes, if desired.
