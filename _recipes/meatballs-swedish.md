title: Swedish Meatballs
description: In my first year of college, I attended a "Meet-ball" with some friends. We ate Italian food and met precisely no-one. Our own meetball was more worthy of the name. Jack told some great stories about his landlady, Mari invited herself to my office Christmas party, and everyone greatly enjoyed the dinner of mashed potatoes, roasted broccoli, lingonberry jam, and of course, meatballs.

ingredients: |
  **Meatballs**
  - 1 lb ground beef
  - 1 lb ground pork
  - 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley, minced
  - 1/2 tsp ground allspice
  - 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
  - 1 medium yellow onion, grated
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - 3/4 cup panko
  - 2 eggs
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - salt
  - pepper

  **Cream Gravy**
  - 1/2 cup butter
  - 1/2 cup flour
  - 4 cups beef broth
  - 1 tbsp lemon juice
  - 1/4 tsp ground allspice
  - 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
  - 1 cup heavy cream
  - salt
  - pepper

instructions: |
  1. In a large bowl, mix the beef, pork, parsley, allspice, nutmeg, grated onion, salt, pepper, garlic, panko, and eggs until combined.
  2. Using a tablespoon, measure out the meat mixture into roughly 35 balls.
  3. In a large pan, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook the meatballs in batches until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.
  4. Pour off any excess grease in the pan into a heatproof vessel. Lower the heat to medium and add the butter. When the butter begins to bubble, sprinkle in the flour and cook for 1 minute. Add the beef broth to the pan a little at a time.
  5. Whisk the gravy until the broth is all incorporated. Add the salt, pepper, lemon juice, allspice, and nutmeg. Whisk a few more times. Slowly add the cream.
  6. Once the gravy begins to simmer, add the meatballs back into the pan.
  7. Simmer until the gravy has thickened up a bit and the meatballs are cooked all the way through, about 8-10 minutes.
  8. Serve warm over mashed potatoes or egg noodles, alongside steamed veggies and lingonberry jam.
