cook_time: 20 minutes
servings: 4
source: NYT
category: Dinner
protein: vegetarian

ingredients: |
Kosher salt and black pepper
6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and patted dry
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 pound brussels sprouts, trimmed and very thinly sliced (about 5 tightly packed cups)
8 ounces dried tagliatelle pasta
½ cup freshly grated Parmesan (about 1½ ounces), plus more for serving
2 tablespoons drained capers
2 tablespoons lemon juice
½ teaspoon red-pepper flakes
¼ cup chopped fresh chives

instructions: |

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil.
Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven or a large, deep skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil over medium. Add chickpeas, season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until deep golden and well toasted, about 5 minutes. Transfer the chickpeas to a paper towel-lined plate.
Add the butter, garlic and 2 tablespoons of the oil to the Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add brussels sprouts, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly caramelized, about 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, cook pasta according to package directions in the boiling water until al dente. Drain, reserving 2 cups of the pasta water.
Add the pasta, 1 cup reserved pasta water, about ¾ of the toasted chickpeas and the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the Dutch oven. Stir in the Parmesan, capers, lemon juice, red-pepper flakes and half the chives until well incorporated and saucy, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add more pasta water if a thinner sauce is desired.
Divide pasta among bowls. Top with remaining toasted chickpeas and chives. Garnish with more black pepper and Parmesan.
