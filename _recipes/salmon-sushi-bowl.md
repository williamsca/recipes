description: 
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 10 minutes
servings: 4
category: Dinner
protein: salmon

ingredients: |
  **For the Sriracha Mayo**
  - ⅓ cup mayonnaise
  - 1 teaspoon sriracha, plus more to taste
  - 2 teaspoons rice vinegar

  **For the Salmon**
  - 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
  - ⅔ cup soy sauce
  - ½ cup rice vinegar
  - ¼ cup honey
  - 6 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
  - 1 (1-pound) salmon fillet, cut into 4 pieces

  **For Serving**
  - 4 cups cooked brown rice
  - 1 English cucumber, sliced
  - 1 avocado, pitted and sliced
  - 2 sheets nori, cut into triangles
  - Sesame seeds, for serving (optional)

instructions: |
  1. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, sriracha, and rice vinegar. Set aside.
  
  2. In a separate small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, garlic, and ginger. Heat the sesame oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add the salmon and sear for 90 seconds on all sides. Arrange the salmon skin-sides down, then pour the soy sauce mixture over the salmon. Cook until the sauce is slightly thickened, and the salmon easily flakes with a fork, about 3 minutes.
  
  3. Divide the rice between bowls. Top with salmon, cucumber, avocado, nori, and sesame seeds, if using. Drizzle with remaining pan sauce and sriracha mayo before serving.
