title: Sausage Gravy
description: Classic Southern breakfast fare that may not win any beauty contests, but is glorious ladled over homemade biscuits.
prep_time: 5 minutes
cook_time: 20 minutes
servings: 6-8
category: Breakfast

ingredients: |
  - 1 pound bulk pork breakfast sausage
  - ¼ cup all-purpose flour
  - 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste
  - 2½ cups whole milk
  - Salt to taste
  - Ground sage to taste (optional)
  - Ground fennel to taste (optional)
  - Ground red pepper to taste

instructions: |
  1. Set a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat and cook the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings - add sage and fennel if desired.
  2. Sprinkle the flour and pepper over the sausage and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour has been absorbed by the fat, approximately 2-5 minutes.
  3. Slowly stir in the milk and cook at a bare simmer until the gravy thickens and coats the back of a spoon. If too thick, add more milk and stir. Check seasonings and serve over biscuits.

notes: |
  - The gravy will continue to thicken as it cools, so make it slightly thinner than your desired final consistency.
  - Pairs perfectly with homemade biscuits for a classic Southern breakfast.
