prep_time: 10 minutes

servings: 6
category: Dinner
protein: sausage
temperature: 
source: The Modern Proper

ingredients: |
  - 16 ounces baby red potatoes, halved
  - 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed
  - Kosher salt, to taste
  - Freshly cracked black pepper, to taste
  - 1 ½ teaspoons dried thyme
  - 4 links fully cooked Italian chicken sausage (12 ounces), ½-inch sliced
  - ½ yellow onion, thinly sliced
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 bunch curly kale, ribs removed and roughly chopped
  - 1 lemon, halved

instructions: |
  1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes and cook until almost fork tender, about 5 minutes. Drain.
  2. Heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once the oil is glistening, working in batches, add the potatoes, cut side down, and cook undisturbed until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir and cook until the potatoes are fork-tender and crispy all over, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a large bowl. Repeat with the remaining potatoes, adding a little more olive oil if necessary. Season the potatoes all over with the salt, pepper, and thyme and toss to combine.
  3. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the skillet. Once the oil is glistening, add the chicken sausage and cook until browned all over, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the sausage to the bowl with the potatoes. Add the onion to the pan and cook, stirring often, until just softened, about 5 minutes.
  4. Reduce the heat to medium. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the kale and cook, stirring often, until wilted, about 3 minutes. Return the potatoes and sausage to the skillet, season with salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Cook until warmed through.
  5. Squeeze the lemon over top and serve.
