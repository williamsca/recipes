description: If the idea of baking Swedish pastries is daunting, or if you simply enjoy the delightful sound of the Swedish language, check out Roy Fares [bakar sina bästa semlor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HCe9W_ZxXk). Swedes enjoy semla between Christmas and Easter, but particularly on Fettisdagen (Fat Tuesday) when a country of 10 million consumes 5 million of the pastry in a single day.

ingredients: |
  **Dough - predough**
  - 0.845 cups milk
  - 1.69 cups flour
  - 25g yeast

  **Add to the forefront**
  - 1.27 cups flour
  - 1 egg
  - 0.5 tsp salt
  - 1 tbsp milled cardamom
  - 0.88 sticks butter, room temperature
  - 0.423 cups sugar

  **Almond pulp**
  - 200g peeled almonds
  - 1 cup sugar
  - a little water

  **Filling**
  - 400g almond pulp
  - 1 tbsp cardamom
  - 5 egg yolks
  - 0.423 cups sugar
  - 3.38 tbsp cornstarch
  - 1 vanilla bean
  - 1 cup whole milk
  - 1 tbsp unsalted butter

  **Topping**
  - whipped cream
  - powdered sugar

instructions: |
  1. **Sponge**: Heat the milk to fingertip temperature. Then mix with flour and yeast and run it in a food processor at the intersection until the forage has gone to a dough. Allow to rest for about 15 minutes.
  2. **Dough**: Mix in the remaining ingredients in the sponge and run for a minute at low speed, then a little faster for about 7 minutes until the dough has become glossy, fine, and feels elastic.
  3. Divide the dough into 14 equal pieces, about 60g per piece. Round the buns with your hands and lay on a plate with baking paper. Allow to rise under cloth at room temperature to double size, about 1.5-2 hours.
  4. Bake in the middle of the oven at 410°F and bake for 8-10 minutes or until the bun has a nice golden brown color.
  5. **Almond**: Pour almonds in boiling water until you see the shell beginning to wrinkle (only a minute or two). Drain well.
  6. Peel each almond and lay in a pile. Boil a little water again and pour over the almonds and let them soak for at least 10 minutes. Drain.
  7. Add almonds and sugar to a food processor with a lid and mix until the almond begins to feel smooth and fine. If necessary, add some water if it feels too dry.
  8. **Almond Filling**: Mix cardamom, egg yolk, sugar, and cornstarch in a bowl.
  9. Divide the vanilla bean in length, scrape out the seeds and put them and the bean in a pan together with the milk. Boil agitated and then pick up the bean. (1 bean equals 1 tbsp extract)
  10. Pour the mixture into the bowl and mix well. Pour it all back into the pan and heat on medium, constantly stirring until it becomes a thick and nice cream.
  11. Pour the cream into a bowl, add the butter and mix. Cover and allow to cool in the fridge for at least 2 hours. Then mix the vanilla cream with almond paste until smooth and creamy.
  12. **Topping**: Cut with scissors to make a triangular lid. Fill the hole with vanilla and almond cream. Add whipped cream on top. Put on the lid and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

notes: |
  - These may also be enjoyed in a bowl with warm milk.
  - One pint of heavy cream is barely enough, so you'll probably want more.
  - Make sure the kitchen is warm enough for the dough to rise!
