ingredients: |
  - 2 medium carrots, diced
  - 2-3 celery stalks, diced
  - 1 white onion, diced
  - 2 tbsp butter
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - 4 cloves garlic
  - 1 tbsp Italian seasoning
  - 2 tbsp flour
  - 6 cups chicken broth
  - 1 cup whole wheat orzo
  - 1 rotisserie chicken
  - Zest and juice of 1 lemon
  - Salt & pepper to taste

instructions: |
  1. Melt butter and oil in a large pot over medium heat.
  2. Add carrots, celery, and onion. Cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
  3. Add garlic and Italian seasoning, cooking until fragrant, about 1 minute.
  4. Sprinkle flour over vegetables and stir to coat. Cook for 1-2 minutes.
  5. Gradually add chicken broth, stirring constantly to prevent lumps.
  6. Bring to a simmer, then add orzo. Cook until orzo is tender, about 8-10 minutes.
  7. Meanwhile, shred the rotisserie chicken into bite-sized pieces.
  8. Add the chicken to the soup and heat through.
  9. Remove from heat and stir in lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste.
  10. Serve hot. For additional brightness, a fresh squeeze of lemon can be added to each bowl.

notes: |
  - For a lighter version, use olive oil instead of butter.
  - You can substitute the rotisserie chicken with 2-3 cups of any cooked chicken.
  - The soup will thicken as it sits because the orzo continues to absorb liquid. Add more broth when reheating leftovers if needed.
  - This soup freezes well, but the orzo may become softer when thawed and reheated.
