servings: 4
category: Soup
temperature: 
source: The Modern Proper
protein: Chicken

ingredients: |
  **Scallion Chili Sesame Oil**
  - ¼ cup toasted sesame oil
  - 1 tablespoon chili paste, we like sambal oelek
  - 4 scallions, white and green parts chopped
  
  **Ramen**
  - 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
  - 4 garlic cloves, minced
  - 2 tablespoons minced peeled fresh ginger
  - 8 cups water plus better than bullion
  - 3 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce
  - 4 scallions, white and green parts, chopped
  - 1.5 cups sliced cooked chicken
  - ½ teaspoon sea salt
  - 4 (3 ounce) packs ramen noodles (flavor packet discarded)
  - 4 6-minute eggs, halved
  - Sesame seeds, optional

instructions: |
  1. Make the scallion chili sesame oil. In a small bowl, combine the sesame oil, chili paste, and scallions.
  2. Make the ramen. Add the sesame oil to a large saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is glistening, add the garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1 minute.
  3. Add the chicken stock, soy sauce, scallions, mushrooms, chicken, and salt and bring to a boil over high heat. If making enough for a second meal, set half the stock aside to cool. Add the ramen noodles (2 packs if only using half the broth today) and boil, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 3 minutes.
  4. To serve, divide the ramen into 2 bowls. Top with the egg halves, drizzle with the scallion oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using.
