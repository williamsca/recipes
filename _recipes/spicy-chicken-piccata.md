servings: 2
prep_time: 15 minutes
cook_time: 15 minutes
protein: chicken
source: Alison Roman
ingredients: |
  - 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1-1 1/4 pounds)
  - Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper
  - 5 garlic cloves
  - 2 tablespoons neutral oil, such as grapeseed or canola, plus more as needed
  - 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided
  - 2 tablespoons capers, drained
  - 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, plus more to taste
  - 1 lemon, very thinly sliced, seeds removed
  - 1 cup dry white wine, such as pinot grigio
  - 1/2 cup parsley, tender leaves and stems, coarsely chopped or torn

instructions: |
  1. Working from the thickest part to the thinnest part, slice each chicken breast in half crosswise (as if butterflying, but cutting all the way through). Each breast should yield two thin pieces rather than two thick chunks.
  2. Place each thin piece between folded parchment paper (or plastic wrap) and use a meat pounder, small heavy skillet, or rolling pin to pound each breast to an even thickness of approximately â…›". For this dish, it is preferable to err on the side of slightly thicker rather than thinner to avoid torn or shredded meat.
  3. Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper; set aside. Thinly slice four cloves of garlic and finely chop the remaining clove; set aside separately.
  4. Heat two tablespoons of neutral oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking, approximately 1-2 minutes. Add two pieces of chicken to the skillet, pressing each piece gently with tongs or a fish spatula to ensure good contact with the pan for optimal browning. Cook until deeply golden brown on one side, 2-4 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat with remaining chicken, adding additional oil if necessary.
  5. Without cleaning the skillet, add 2 tablespoons of butter, sliced garlic, and capers. Using a wooden spoon, tongs, or fish spatula, scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan (more will release when the wine is added). Cook, swirling occasionally, until garlic and capers are golden brown and crispy, approximately 2 minutes. Transfer half of the garlic and capers to a small bowl; reserve.
  6. Add the crushed red pepper flakes, half of the lemon slices, and all of the white wine to the skillet. Bring to a simmer and cook until the liquid has reduced by about half and thickened, approximately 4-6 minutes.
  7. Remove the skillet from heat and add the remaining tablespoon of butter, remaining lemon slices, and the finely chopped garlic. Swirl the skillet to melt the butter. Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and additional crushed red pepper flakes if desired. The sauce should be tangy, buttery, spicy, and properly salted.
  8. Pour the sauce over the chicken and garnish with the reserved crispy garlic/capers, parsley, and additional crushed red pepper flakes if desired.

notes: |
  - This version of chicken piccata omits the traditional flour dredging to create a cleaner, less soggy result.
  - The sauce balances tangy lemon, rich butter, and spicy pepper flakes for a more complex flavor profile.
  - Using half the lemon slices at different stages provides both tender cooked lemon and fresh bright acidity.
