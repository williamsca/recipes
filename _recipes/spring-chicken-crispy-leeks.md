instructions: |
  **For the chicken and salsa verde:**
  1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Place chicken on a rimmed baking sheet or a large (10-12") cast-iron skillet. Pat the bird dry with paper towels and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. The cavity may be stuffed with a halved lemon, quartered onion, halved head of garlic, or herb sprigs if desired. Tie the chicken legs together in a loose truss if preferred.
  2. Remove the darkest green part of the leek (reserve for the salsa verde) and quarter the remaining white/light green part lengthwise. Rinse thoroughly to remove any grit. For smaller leeks, simply halve them lengthwise. Arrange the leeks beside the chicken and drizzle both with olive oil. Season the leeks with salt and pepper.
  3. Place the baking sheet in the oven (middle rack if possible) and allow to roast undisturbed for at least 35 minutes. Avoid opening the oven during this initial roasting period.
  4. After 35 minutes, check the chicken. It will likely require additional cooking time. At this point, you may baste or rotate the pan if desired. Continue roasting for another 20-25 minutes. The finished chicken should have deeply browned skin, and the leeks should be both tender and caramelized with crispy edges.
  5. While the chicken roasts, prepare the salsa verde. Finely chop the reserved dark green leek parts and place in a small bowl. Add the chopped chives, parsley, and anchovies (or capers). Season with salt and pepper. Add a splash of vinegar or fresh lemon juice, then incorporate enough olive oil to create a spoonable sauce. This mixture should have pronounced onion, brine, brightness, and herb flavors. Allow to rest while the chicken finishes cooking as the flavors will develop over time.

  **For the aioli and serving:**
  6. Combine the oils in a bowl or measuring cup with a pouring spout. Place egg yolk, mustard, and garlic in a medium bowl. Gradually whisk in the oil, beginning with a few teaspoons and adding more as it becomes fully incorporated. If the mixture becomes too thick, thin with a small amount of white vinegar. Continue adding oil until completely incorporated. Season with salt, additional vinegar, and more garlic if desired.
  7. Arrange all vegetables (blanched, boiled, and raw) on a large plate. If you opened a tin of anchovies for the sauce, place the remaining anchovies alongside the vegetables.
  8. To carve the chicken, first tilt it slightly in its roasting vessel to collect any juices. Remove the legs from the body before transferring to a cutting board to avoid losing valuable drippings. After carving, transfer the chicken to a large serving plate. Top with the crispy leeks and pour any collected juices over the entire dish.
  9. Serve with the leek salsa verde, aioli, and the arranged vegetables. Suggestions for enjoying the meal include dipping chicken in both sauces, pairing with boiled potatoes, placing anchovies on radishes with aioli, and ensuring to savor the juices that collect on the plate.

notes: |
  - The crispy leeks are a highlight of this dish - don't be afraid to let them develop deep color.
  - The salsa verde uses the dark green parts of leeks that would typically be discarded.
  - This dish is designed as a complete spring meal with the accompaniments.
