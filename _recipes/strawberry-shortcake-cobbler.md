ingredients: |
  **Shortcakes**
  - 1¼ cups (181 grams) all-purpose flour, plus more for the work surface
  - ½ cup (78 grams) coarse yellow cornmeal
  - 2 tablespoons (27.5 grams) light brown sugar
  - 2 tablespoons (25 grams) granulated sugar
  - 1 tablespoon (12 grams) baking powder
  - ¾ teaspoon (2 grams) kosher salt
  - ½ cup (113 grams) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch pieces, at room temperature
  - ½ cup (113.5 grams) heavy cream

  **Filling**
  - 5 cups (750 grams) strawberries (about 2 quarts), hulled and halved
  - ½ cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
  - 2 tablespoons (14 grams) cornstarch
  - 1 tablespoon (14.5 grams) fresh lime or lemon juice
  - 2 tablespoons (14 grams) heavy cream
  - 2 tablespoons (27.5 grams) light brown sugar

instructions: |
  1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
  2. For the shortcakes: In a large bowl, combine the flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt. Using your hands, incorporate the butter into the flour mixture until no large chunks remain. Add the cream and mix with your hands just until blended. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead just until it is no longer excessively sticky, approximately 2 minutes.
  3. Form the dough into a circle about 1 inch thick. Using a 2-inch cookie cutter (or an approximation such as a water glass or mason jar), cut out as many shortcakes as possible. Re-form the scraps to 1 inch thickness and repeat until all the dough is used. Set the shortcakes aside while preparing the filling. If they feel too soft, transfer to the refrigerator.
  4. For the filling: In a medium bowl, combine the strawberries with the granulated sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice. Transfer the berries to a 9-inch cast-iron skillet, pie dish, or cake pan (a 9 x 13-inch baking dish will also work if necessary) and arrange the shortcakes on top.
  5. Brush the tops of the shortcakes with the cream and sprinkle with the brown sugar. Bake until the shortcakes are golden brown and the juices of the strawberries have thickened and bubbled up around the edges of the skillet, approximately 25 to 30 minutes.
  6. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before serving. This cooling period serves two purposes: it prevents unnecessary mouth burns and allows the juices to set so the dessert is not excessively runny.

notes: |
  - The shortcakes get baked right on top of the strawberries, allowing the berries to release their juices and create a delicious syrupy sauce while roasting.
  - This recipe combines the classic elements of strawberry shortcake in a more efficient, family-style format.
