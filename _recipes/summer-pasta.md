category: Dinner
protein: vegetarian

ingredients: |
  - Extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1 small onion, finely diced
  - 2 pounds zucchini, sliced into ¼-inch-thick pieces
  - Salt and pepper
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 ounce basil, about 2 cups loose leaves
  - 1 pound ziti or other dry pasta
  - 8 ounces ricotta, about 1 cup
  - Pinch of crushed red pepper
  - Zest of 1 lemon
  - 2 ounces grated Parmesan or pecorino, about 1 cup, plus more for serving

instructions: |
  1. Bring a pot of water to boil. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook onions in 3 tablespoons olive oil until softened, 5-8 minutes. Add zucchini, season with salt and pepper, and cook until soft, about 10 minutes.
  2. Meanwhile, pound garlic, basil and a little salt into a rough paste using a mortar and pestle (or mini food processor). Stir in 3 tablespoons olive oil.
  3. Salt the pasta water well and cook pasta al dente according to package instructions. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup cooking water.
  4. Add cooked pasta to zucchini in skillet over medium-high heat. Add ½ cup cooking water, ricotta, crushed red pepper and lemon zest, stirring to distribute. If needed, add more pasta water for a creamy consistency. Add the basil paste and half the cheese and quickly stir. Serve immediately with additional cheese.

notes: |
  - For a variation, try adding anchovy, preserved lemon, or more red pepper flakes to the zucchini mixture.
  - The key to this dish is cooking the zucchini until it's soft enough to form a creamy sauce when combined with the pasta water and ricotta.
