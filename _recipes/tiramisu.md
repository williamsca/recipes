menu: A luxurious Italian classic layering espresso-soaked ladyfingers with rich mascarpone cream, finished with a dusting of cocoa and shaved chocolate.

ingredients: |
  - 2 1/2 cups strong black coffee, room temperature
  - 1 1/2 tablespoons instant espresso powder
  - 9 tablespoons dark rum
  - 6 large egg yolks
  - 2/3 cup sugar
  - 1/4 teaspoon salt
  - 1 1/2 pounds (680 grams) mascarpone cheese, cold
  - 1/3 cup cream, for adding to yolks
  - 3/4 cup cold heavy cream, for whipping
  - 14 ounces (400 grams) ladyfingers
  - 3 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder, preferably Dutch-processed
  - 1/4 cup semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, grated

instructions: |
  1. Stir coffee, espresso, and 5 tablespoons rum in a wide bowl until espresso dissolves; set aside.
  2. In bowl of standing mixer with whisk attachment, beat yolks at low speed until just combined. Add sugar and salt and beat at medium speed until pale yellow, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes, scraping down bowl with rubber spatula. Add 1/3 cup cream to yolks and beat at medium speed until just combined, 20 to 30 seconds; scrape bowl.
  3. Boil 1 inch of water in a medium saucepan
  4. Set bowl with yolks over saucepan and cook, constantly scraping along bottom and sides of bowl with rubber spatula, until mixture registers 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 4 to 7 minutes.
  5. Remove from heat and stir vigorously to cool, then set aside to cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes.
  6. Whisk in remaining 4 tablespoons rum. Transfer bowl to standing mixer fitted with whisk attachment, add mascarpone, and beat at medium speed until no lumps remain, 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer mixture to large bowl and set aside.
  7. In now-empty mixer bowl, beat 3/4 cup cream at medium speed until frothy, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. Increase speed to high and continue to beat until cream holds stiff peaks, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes longer. Fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture until no white streaks remain. Set mascarpone mixture aside.
  8. Working one at a time, drop half of ladyfingers into coffee mixture, roll, remove, and transfer to 13 by 9-inch glass or ceramic baking dish. (Do not submerge ladyfingers in coffee mixture; entire process should take no longer than 2 to 3 seconds for each cookie.) Arrange soaked cookies in single layer in baking dish, breaking or trimming ladyfingers as needed to fit neatly into dish. Spread mascarpone over ladyfingers and dust with cocoa; repeat process with remaining cookies, mascarpone, and cocoa. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 6 to 24 hours. Sprinkle with grated chocolate before serving.
