servings: 4

protein: Sausage
temperature: 
source: The Modern Proper

ingredients: |
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 12-14 ounces smoked or Italian sausage links (chicken or pork), cooked, 1/2-inch sliced
  - 3 garlic cloves, minced
  - 2 (15-ounce) cans white beans, like great northern, butter beans or cannellini, rinsed and drained
  - 1 ½ cups chicken stock
  - ½ teaspoon kosher salt
  - ¼ teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper
  - 1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves
  - ½ bunch curly kale, stems removed, leaves torn into bite size pieces, about 3 cups packed
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice
  - ½ cup parmesan, plus extra for serving
  - red pepper flakes, optional

instructions: |
  1. In a 12-inch skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage and cook on both sides until browned, about 4-5 minutes. Set the sausage aside.
  
  2. Add the garlic to the pan and cook until fragrant, about 15 seconds. Add ⅔ of the beans and 1 cup of chicken stock to the skillet and season with salt, pepper and thyme, stir to combine and bring to a simmer over medium heat.
  
  3. In a medium bowl, smash remaining beans with a fork until a thick paste is formed. Add the smashed beans back into the skillet and stir to combine. Simmer until the beans are heated through and the stock is simmering, about 2-3 minutes.
  
  4. Add the kale, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often until sauce becomes creamy, is slightly reduced and kale has wilted, about 2 minutes more.
  
  5. Add the parmesan, lemon and sausage to the pan. Stir to combine. Add remaining stock a little at a time if you need more creaminess. Adjust seasoning to taste.
  
  6. Serve with extra parmesan cheese, red pepper flakes if desired, alongside some crusty bread!
