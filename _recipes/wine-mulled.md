ingredients: |
  - 2 large oranges
  - 4¼ cups/1 liter red wine
  - 1¼ cups/10 ounces brandy
  - ½ cup dark brown sugar
  - 2 cinnamon sticks
  - 6 whole cloves
  - 3 cardamom pods, slightly crushed

instructions: |
  1. Using a peeler, remove the peel in strips from 1 orange then juice the orange. Slice the other orange into rounds and reserve for garnish.
  2. In a nonreactive saucepan, combine orange peel, juice and the rest of the ingredients. Stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves, about 2 minutes. 
  3. Increase the heat to high, bring mixture to a boil, then immediately reduce the heat to low. Simmer gently until flavors meld, about 30 minutes. 
  4. Strain the mixture, discarding the solids.
  5. Ladle into cups or mugs. Garnish each with a reserved orange round.

notes: |
  - The store brand Malbec from Aldi is a good choice for this recipe, but you can also try a basic Australian Shiraz, an Italian Primitivo, or the inexpensive Zweigelt from Erdenlied.
