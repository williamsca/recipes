**First Edition.** Here are a few of the recipes that we’ve cooked together since we met. You told me once
that you fall more in the ‘live to eat’ category, so I hope you appreciate this collection. I
know I have loved every minute of cooking (and eating) with you, and I look forward to many
more hours of enjoying food together. The recipes are divided into dishes and desserts and
recorded in the sequence that we made them - I know how much you dislike going out of
order. *Williamstown, MA. 12-20-2017.*

**Second Edition.** We’ve spent a lot of time together since you moved to Washington, and for a majority of it
we were cooking or cleaning up (although watching Gilmore Girls may be a close second).
As you rightly observed, one of the top five benefits to dating is the fact that you can cook
reasonable quantities of food and not have to eat it for the rest of the week. It’s also nice
to have a shared project. I like how our Swedish connection continues to reverberate; in
this edition, I have added both Swedish Meatballs and kladdkaka, among a number of other
items. *Washington, DC. 11-25-2019.*

**Third Edition.** Very few things give me as much joy as seeing your face light up after a long day at the
hospital when you see what’s for dinner. The pandemic may have kept us from eating out,
but we certainly did not eat poorly. *Charlottesville, VA. 12-8-2021.*

**Fourth Edition.** There are plenty changes after you have your first baby, but the biggest one here is the addition of a [Breakfast](/categories/breakfast/) section. Even with Ramona constantly underfoot, we've become experts at the classic breakfasts: biscuits and gravy, pancakes, and even casserole and cinnamon rolls. There is no better meal, in my book, than cooking and eating an unhurried breakfast while the little one takes her morning nap. *Charlottesville, VA. 1-22-2025.*
